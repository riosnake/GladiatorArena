# GladiatorArena
A project created while working for iD Tech to help teach students the usefulness of object-oriented design and introduce child classes and polymorphism.
I created this project for a week-long course on programming because I noticed that, while my teaching style encouraged project-based work, I did not have
a good project to really give students when it came to classes and object oriented programming. When I had a class with AP CS students, we worked on creating
a game similar to this, and when onestudent asked if they could fight their classmates, this idea struck me.

# Files
MyGladiator.cpp is the file that would be handed to students, with me explaining how the project would work and any important points they should be aware of.
After receiving this base code, each student would come up with mechanics and abilities they wanted their gladiator to do and implement them within the class.
This allowed students to express their creativity when coming up with their class, as well as get hands-on experience with understanding object-oriented structure.

Colloseum.cpp is the file I would use to have each students gladiator fight each other. When that time came, I would have the students send me their modified 
MyGladiator.cpp files, and I would change them to be a child class of the Gladiator class, and then after everything was set up I would explain the concepts
that allowed this project to work, and then share my screen and run the program on my machine.

While it is true that best design practices would have me implement each class as individual files with a header file to link them to main,
I purposefully chose to include all those classes within a single file to help simplify setup and reduce complexity for the students.
